This is the first post of a new blog where I will be writing what I learn while trying to become an ethical hacker / bug bounty hunter. This blog was created using Jekyll, and it is hosted on Github Pages. You can check out the repo on Github [here](https://github.com/eriklarson84/eriklarson84.github.io).
