This is a blog documenting my journey of learning how to hack. I am doing an Individual Learning Endeavor (ILE) project for school, and my topic of choice is Ethical Hacking and Bug Bounty Hunting. I will spend time each day dedicated to learning about my topic, and at the end of each week I will write my findings here.
